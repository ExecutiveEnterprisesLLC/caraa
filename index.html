    <h2>Meaning of Advocacy</h2>
    <p>The word ‘advocacy’ takes its roots from the Latin ‘od vocare’ meaning to speak for someone. Proposing or recommending something or someone for better options. It implies identifying a cause, believing in it, mobilizing and influencing others to support it so as to change the policy or program that is negatively affecting that cause.</p>
