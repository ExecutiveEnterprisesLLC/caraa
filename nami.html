                        <br>
                        <br> NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, is the nation’s largest grassroots mental health
                        organization dedicated to building better lives for the millions of Americans affected by mental
                        illness. What started as a small group of families gathered around a kitchen table in 1979 has blossomed
                        into the nation's leading voice on mental health. Today, we are an association of hundreds of local
                        affiliates, state organizations and volunteers who work in your community to raise awareness and
                        provide support and education that was not previously available to those in need. A mental Illness
                        is a condition that impacts a person’s thinking, feeling, or mood and may affect his or her ability
                        to relate to others and function on a daily basis. Each person will have different experiences, even
                        people with the same diagnosis. Recovery, including meaningful roles in social life, school and work,
                        is possible, especially when you start treatment early and play a strong role in your dependent’s
                        recovery process.
                        <br>
                        <br> A mental health condition isn’t the result of one event. Research suggest multiple, interlinking
                        causes. Genetics, environment and lifestyle combine to influence whether someone develops a mental
                        health condition. A stressful job or home life makes some people more susceptible, as do traumatic
                        life events like being the victim of a crime. Biochemical processes and circuits as well as basic
                        brain structure may play a role too.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Recovery and Wellness</h2>
                    <p>50% of mental illness conditions begin by age 14 and 75% of mental health conditions develop by age 245.
                        The normal personality and behavior changes of adolescence may mimic or mask symptoms of a mental
                        health condition. Early engagement and support are crucial to improving outcomes and increasing the
                        promise of recovery. In addition to the person directly experiencing a mental illness, family, friends
                        and communities are also affected.

                    <h2>Depression</h2>
                    <p>Depression is more than just feeling sad or going through a rough patch: it’s a serious mental health
                        condition that requires understanding and treatment.</p>

                    <h2>Dissociative Disorders</h2>

                    <p>When someone becomes so preoccupied with food and weight issues that they find it hard to focus on other
                        aspects of life, it may be a sign of an eating disorder.</p>

                    <h2>Schizophrenia</h2>
                    <p>Schizophrenia causes people to lose touch with reality, often in the form of hallucinations, delusions
                        and extremely disordered thinking and behavior. 1 This document cites statistics provided by the
                        National Institute of Mental Health.
