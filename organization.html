                        <b>Lori Boelig</b> is the President of The Children at Risk Advocacy Association. She attended the University
                        of New Hampshire graduating with degrees in Psychology and Occupational Therapy. She began her professional
                        career in 1979 at New Hampshire Hospital, an inpatient state psychiatric hospital, and has worked
                        there since 2005 when she returned after being a stay-at-home mother. While focusing on raising her
                        three children, she engaged in various volunteer organizations in their schools and community. In
                        her current role as a psychiatric occupational therapist, she has had training in trauma-informed
                        care and the sequelae of childhood trauma. This, in conjunction with friends and colleagues supporting
                        the foster care systems in both NH and MA, has inspired her contributions in bringing focus and support
                        to children at risk. She currently manages the L’Dor V’Dor Charitable Foundation and is on the Board
                        of Directors of Genesis Behavioral Health, her local community mental health center.</p>

                        <b>Carline Woods</b> is the Treasurer of the Children at Risk Advocacy Association. She studied Accounting
                        at Briarwood College in Southington, CT and Biology at Central Connecticut State University. After
                        college, she ran a bustling horse stable, Fairweather Farm in Bristol, CT. While teaching riding
                        lessons to area children, she was introduced to therapeutic riding for individuals with disabilities.
                        She later became a NARHA certified therapeutic riding instructor and went on to serve on the Board
                        of Directors at Shepard Meadows Therapeutic Riding Center in Bristol, CT from 2005-2009. It was through
                        her work at Shepard Meadows that she was introduced to the foster care system. The children made
                        an impact on her and she began to prioritize working with children at risk. She developed experiential
                        learning programs that would teach coping skills through the children’s interactions with the horses.
                        She collaborated with the Bristol Community Organization’s summer work program and developed a farm
                        based work program for teenagers. She is currently developing a farm based curriculum which would
                        teach youth at risk basic math, science, history and life skills using animal care and farm maintenance.
                        She also owns CMW Tax Services, LLC in Bristol, CT.
