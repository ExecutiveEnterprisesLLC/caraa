CARAA has a written donor policy in place, which states unambiguously that it will not sell, trade, or share a donor’s personal information with anyone else, nor send donor mailings on behalf of other organizations. In addition, we follow the Association of Fundraising Professionals’ “donor bill of rights” (see below).
