                    <h2>The United States</h2>
                    <p>In the 15th issuance of Child Welfare Outcomes 2010 – 2014 Report to Congress on children’s safety permanency
                        and wellbeing, it is reported that During 2014, approximately 702,000 children were confirmed to
                        be victims of maltreatment. For the purposes of this report, a victim is a child for whom the state
                        determined at least one maltreatment incident was substantiated or indicated, and a disposition of
                        substantiated, indicated, or “alternative response victim” was assigned for a child in a specific
                        report. This includes a child who died, and the death was confirmed to be the result of child abuse
                        and neglect. A child may be a victim in one report and a nonvictim in another report. It is important
                        to note that the Child Welfare Outcomes Report uses the total reported number of child victims as
                        opposed to a national estimate of child victims, which often is reported in the Child Maltreatment
                        Report. The total number of victims reported in this report is rounded to the nearest 1,000.
                        <br>
                        <br> The overall national child victim rate was 9.4 child victims per 1,000 children in the population.
                        The national child victim rate is calculated by dividing the total number of child victims (702,208)
                        by the child population for all states that submitted NCANDS data (74,356,370) and multiplying by
                        1,000. This calculation includes children under the age of 18.
                        <br>
                        <br> State child victim rates varied dramatically, ranging from 1.2 child victims per 1,000 children
                        to 22.9 child victims per 1,000 children. Nationally, there were approximately 415,000 children in
                        foster care on the last day of 2014. During that year, an estimated 260,000 children entered foster
                        care, and 238,000 children exited foster care. Of these children, 204,000 (86 percent) were discharged
                        to a permanent home (i.e., were discharged to reunification, adoption, or legal guardianship). Between
                        2005 and 2014, the number of children in care on the last day of the FY decreased by 18.8 percent,
                        from 511,000 to 415,000.10 For more information, see Trends in Foster Care and Adoption—FY 2005–FY
